## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite with custom development plugins for Replit integration
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state and data fetching
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming (light/dark mode support)
- **Component Library**: shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives) with custom styling
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization (bar charts, pie charts, line charts)

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API Pattern**: RESTful API with `/api` prefix
- **Storage Interface**: Abstracted storage layer (`IStorage`) with in-memory implementation (`MemStorage`), designed for easy database migration

### Data Layer
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Schema Validation**: Zod with drizzle-zod integration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable)
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema migrations (output to `/migrations`)

### Design System
The application follows a hybrid design approach inspired by Linear, TradingView, and Notion:
- **Typography**: Inter/IBM Plex Sans for UI, IBM Plex Mono for data/numbers
- **Color System**: HSL-based CSS variables with semantic naming
- **Spacing**: Tailwind standardized units (2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16)
- **Components**: Cards, tables, forms with dense data presentation

### Key Features
- Trade entry form with quick data input
- Operations table with filtering and sorting
- Calendar view for date-based trade visualization
- Statistics dashboard with performance metrics
- Confluence tracking (pro/contro factors per trade)
- Emotional state tracking per trade
- Weekly recap and mood tracker
- Configurable pairs, emotions, and confluence options
- Risk/Reward (RR) ratio calculation and display

### Authentication Flow
1. User registers with email/password
2. First registered user becomes super_admin (auto-approved)
3. Subsequent users are "pending" until admin approves
4. Admins can approve, reject, or revoke user access
5. Only approved users can access the trading journal
6. Super admins can promote users to admin role
